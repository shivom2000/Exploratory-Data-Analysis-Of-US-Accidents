In this notebook we present the approach of Proper Questioning the dataset while taking care of our main moto which is extracting various interesting facts with the help of EDA.

This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to December 2020, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 1.5 million accident records in this dataset. Check here to learn more about this dataset.
